## Importing data from the google sheet

```{r, include=FALSE}
sheet <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xzpre5Ej_7OEGRU4EA7KZuMQnSz5YCyTx5Sdbml6bQE/edit#gid=0"

main <- read_sheet(sheet)
df <- main %>% filter(Scrape_date >= "2023-08-20") %>% filter(ID < 30000) %>% filter(is.na(Hydrogen_relevance))
#filtering out the danish ads, will be removed when we have fixed so that the main-file contains the "real" description

smpl_20 <- df %>% slice_sample(n = 20)

not_na <- main %>% filter(!is.na(Hydrogen_relevance))
h2_no <- not_na %>% filter(Hydrogen_relevance == "No")
```

## Defining function

```{python}
from openai import OpenAI
import os

key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
client = OpenAI(api_key = key)

def ai_chat(system_behaviour, user_prompt):
  
  response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-4-0125-preview",
  temperature = 0.5,
  max_tokens = 1000,
  messages=[
      {"role": "system", "content": system_behaviour},
      {"role": "user", "content": user_prompt}
      ]
      )
  return(response.choices[0].message.content)

```

## Running the function

```{r}
sys_beh <- c('You are a helpful assistant that classifies different job ads as "Yes" or "No" depending on if the job described in the ad is related to hydrogen or not. Some of the ads may contain a description of the company, ignore that part of the text and focus on the part describing the job. The ad should be classified as "Yes" if it for example states that the position involves usage or production of hydrogen. It is also a "Yes" if the position is related to manufacturing parts that are used in production/usage of hydrogen or if the position involves working in projects related to hydrogen. If the ad is not classified as "Yes" it should be classified as "No" or if tou are unable to classify it "Unknown". The word ‘hydrogen’ or its variations will appear in all ads, but be cautious it might be used as a buzzword.')


result <- data.frame(id = numeric(), h2 = character())

for (row in 1:nrow(smpl_20)) {
  prompt <- paste("Please classify this job ad:",smpl_20$Description[row])
  ans <- py$ai_chat(sys_beh, prompt)
  result <- rbind(result, data.frame(id = smpl_20$ID[row], h2 = ans))
}

```

## Saving the result

```{r}
# Update the 'ID' and 'Hydrogen_relevance' columns in the 'Main' worksheet
main <- main %>%
  mutate(Hydrogen_relevance = ifelse(ID %in% result$id, result$h2[match(ID, result$id)], Hydrogen_relevance))

# Write the updated dataframe back to the 'Main' worksheet
write_sheet(main, ss = sheet, sheet = "Main")

```
