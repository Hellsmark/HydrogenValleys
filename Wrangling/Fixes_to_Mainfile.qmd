# Changes to company analysis

## Data

```{r}
ss <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xzpre5Ej_7OEGRU4EA7KZuMQnSz5YCyTx5Sdbml6bQE/edit#gid=0"

file_companies <- read_sheet(ss, sheet = "CompanyAnalysis")
file_mainpage <- read_sheet(ss, sheet = "Main")
file_locations <- read_sheet(ss, sheet = "locations_coord")
```

## Fixes

Each "fix" has been done at separate occasions.

### Update sector names

```{r}
# Replace old to new name for sectors
file_companies_updated <- file_companies %>% 
  mutate(Industry_Sector = recode(Industry_Sector,
                           "Research/Education" = "Research & Education",
                           "Legal/HR/Economics" = "Legal & Economics",
                           "Government/Public sector" = "Government & Public sector",
                           "Iron/steel/mining" = "Metals & Mining",
                           "Oil/gas/refinery" = "Fossil fuel & Refinery",
                           "Energy Utility" = "Energy utility"))
```

### Fix incorrect entries in Location of jobs

```{r}
jobs_and_locations <- file_mainpage %>% 
  left_join(file_locations, by = c("Location"="New_name"), relationship = "many-to-many") %>%
  select(Company, Country_code) %>%
  unique() %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  group_by(Company) %>%
  summarise(Country_code = paste(sort(unique(Country_code)), collapse = ", ")) %>%
  ungroup()

file_companies_updated <- file_companies %>%
  left_join(jobs_and_locations, by = c("Name" = "Company")) %>%
  select(Name, Description, Number_of_adds, Location_of_jobs = Country_code, Multinational, Organisation_type, Ownership_type, Industry_Sector, Hydrogen_relevance, Hydrogen_relevance_motivation, Hydrogen_specialist, Nationality, Founded_year)
