## Initiation - Delete python?
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```
### R-libraries
```{r, include = FALSE}
library(googlesheets4)

```
### Python packages 
```{python}
from openai import OpenAI

app_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")

df = pd.DataFrame()
```

## Google get

## Function
```{python}

client = OpenAI(api_key=app_key)

def relevance(text):
  example = "[['Company1','Yes','They produce electrolysers which are used to produce hydrogen'],['CompanyB','No','This is a municipality, they do not work with hydrogen'],['CompanyC','Yes','They have a project where they produce e-methanol by using hydrogen as one of their inputs']]"
  content = "You are a helpful assistent that when provided a list of names of organisations finds out whether they are related to the hydrogen economy in the nordics or not. This can be either 'Yes' (if the organisations works with either directly producing or consuming hydrogen in their business, or the organisation either develops/research or manufacture either machines or components specifically made to be used to either produce or make use of hydrogen as input or if the organisation provides services or goods which could be relevant for the hydrogen economy or the general use of hydrogen, even if hydrogen is in no way their main focus), or 'No' (if the organisation has no service related to hydrogen, or the relation to the hydrogen economy is unclear). You choose the category which you find to be most fitting. You respond with one out of the two categories as well as a short motivation of why the company is cathegorised as hydrogen relevant or not. Your response should be in the form of a python list where each company has its own list with the Yes/No answer as one item in the list and the motivation as a second item in the list. Start each companylist with the name of the company. Do not add any text or characters outside of the list and it should be able to be read as a python list. Here is an example: "+example
  prompt = f"Classify the following companies: '{text}'"
